	<li>your name;</li>
	<li>whether you want to donate anonymously;</li>
	<li>whether you would like to participate in voting for a winner.</li>

<p>You will receive a confirmation email and a transaction ID within two business days, and your contribution
	will appear on the spreadsheet above.</p>

<p>At this time, we have not been recognized as a nonprofit by the IRS and contributions are not tax-deductible.
	This is only likely to affect you if you itemize deductions.</p>
