			He grew up in State College, graduating from State High in 2006 and Penn State in 2011. 
			He spends most of his day learning about stuff and
			<a href="http://www.brandoncurtis.com/">putting it on the Internet</a>.

			Zach Gotsch is slightly less cool, but still cool enough to be involved in this project
			even though he didn't go to State High.
			He does something with computers all day, blah blah, software engineering, &etc &etc.
			<a href="https://twitter.com/CodeAthena">Follow him on Twitter</a>.

			Brian Leyde did the cool thing and graduated from State High in 2006
			and Penn State in 2011. Seventeen years of school wasn't enough, so he moved
			to <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Madison,+WI/@43.0849935,-89.4064204,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x8806536d3a2019ff:0x4e0cfcb5ba484198">
			a town that looks conspiculously like State College</a> and spent a couple more years
			at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Wisconsin%E2%80%93Madison">
			a land grant school that looks conspiculously like Penn State</a>.
			Another piece of paper in hand, he decided to stay there a while longer
			and	work at a startup (aka Do All The Things).
			A semi-famous scam artist shares his name, so
			<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Brian+Leyde">don't Google him</a>.
